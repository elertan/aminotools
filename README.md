# AminoTools

This application extends on Amino's current functionalities.

For example:

- Global Chatting -> No more need to keep switching between different communities to chat with your friends!
- Global Profile -> Make one profile appear on every different amino.
- Global Post (Not sure if this will be included) -> Make the same post appear on many different communities!

*Global Posting is still not implemented, and most likely ever will, due to the user's ability to abuse this feature to cause a lot of chaos on the communities*

*Desktop version of the app is also not building anymore, and I'm not looking to support it anytime soon. This is mainly due to the app relying on external dependecies that just don't exist for the desktop platform yet.*
